## Formatting Rules (applies to all 7 SWMS + painting master)

### Build-time rules (`build_all_swms.py`)

1. **HOLD POINT numbering:** `1. 2. 3.` (not `(1) (2) (3)`)
2. **Risk cells:** Contrasting text colour — white on red, black on yellow/green
3. **Code cells:** No background colour. Black bold text for all tasks (STD and CCVS)
4. **PPE standardisation:**
   - "Safety glasses" → **Eye protection**
   - "Hearing protection" → **Hearing protection (>85 dB)**
   - "Gloves" (generic) → **Cut-resistant gloves**
   - "High-vis vest" → **High-vis vest or shirt**
   - Specific glove types (nitrile, leather, insulating, blast) unchanged
5. **Hazard column:** Split at `. ` into open-circle bulleted list (one hazard per bullet)
6. **Bullet/numbering indent:** 0.4cm hanging (`BULLET_INDENT = '227'` twips) — all lists

### Post-processor rules (`format_swms.py`)

7. **Em dashes (—):** Bold + capitalise following letter
8. **Font:** Aptos 8pt on all runs (sz=16 half-points)
9. **Control labels:** Engineering:, Admin:, PPE:, Supervision: → bold; STOP WORK / HOLD POINT → bold + yellow highlight
10. **Sub-labels:** Any capitalised "Label:" pattern at start of run → bold
11. **Task descriptions:** `[bracketed text]` → italic, dark grey (444444)
12. **Emergency Response:** Bold + red highlight + white text
