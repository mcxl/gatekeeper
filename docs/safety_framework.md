# Gatekeeper Safety Framework

## Overview
Gatekeeper is a Zero-Trust safety framework designed to prevent normalization of deviance in high-risk construction environments.

## Core Principles
- Mandatory mental checkpoints
- Data-driven risk assessment
- Systematic safety intervention

## Key Components
1. **Mental Checkpoints**
   - Interrupt automatic work processes
   - Force deliberate safety engagement
   - Prevent complacency

2. **Audit Classification**
   - Quantitative risk scoring
   - Objective safety assessment
   - Actionable risk insights

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Trend identification
   - Proactive risk management
   - Continuous improvement

## Implementation Strategy
- Integrate with existing safety protocols
- Minimal disruption to workflow
- Scalable across different construction contexts
