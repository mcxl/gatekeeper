# Gatekeeper Reference Documents Index

## Purpose
These documents are the authoritative reference library for Gatekeeper's WHS advisory functions. Agents should consult these when:
- Generating or reviewing SWMS
- Advising on WHS procedures for RPD operations
- Benchmarking RPD's system against principal contractor expectations
- Scoping upgrades to the RPD WHS Management System
- Preparing for Ed.6 audits or Project Remediate pre-qualification

## How Gatekeeper Agents Should Use This Library

### SWMS Generator Agent
- Cross-reference hazard-specific HY Standards (e.g. Work at Height, Asbestos) to ensure SWMS control measures meet principal contractor expectations
- Use RPD V7 Section 4 procedures as the baseline for RPD-specific controls

### WHS Advisor Agent
- When recommending a procedure, check if Hansen Yuncken has a corresponding standard/procedure and use it as a quality benchmark
- Reference the Bare Minimum Ed.6 Review to confirm whether a proposed procedure is actually required by Ed.6 or is optional
- Use the Ed.6 Guidelines Appendix D checklists as the compliance checklist

### System Upgrade Agent
- Follow the Bare Minimum Ed.6 Review section-by-section as the upgrade specification
- Use the KEEP/REVISE/ELIMINATE/BREADCRUMB statuses as the action list for V8
