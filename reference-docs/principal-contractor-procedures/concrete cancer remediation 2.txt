The Remediation Process for Concrete Cancer
Once we’ve finished the diagnostic work and have a crystal-clear picture of what we're up against, it’s time to get our hands dirty. This is where we move into the practical, multi-stage process of fixing concrete cancer. Let me be clear: this isn't a quick patch job. It’s a methodical structural repair designed to last, and every single step is critical to making sure the problem doesn't come back.

From the moment a diagnosis is confirmed, the clock is ticking. Delaying the repair allows the corrosion to keep spreading like a disease through the structure, which only makes the eventual fix more complex and much more expensive. That’s why we move on it, and we move fast.

This systematic approach ensures we have a complete grasp of both the visible and hidden damage before we even think about picking up a tool.

Securing the Site with Temporary Propping
Before a single bit of concrete is chipped away, safety is paramount. If the concrete cancer has compromised load-bearing elements—think beams, columns, or slabs—we absolutely have to make the area structurally sound first. This is done with temporary propping.

We bring in heavy-duty props and shoring systems to support the structure, essentially taking the weight off the damaged section. This crucial step eliminates any risk of collapse while we work and keeps the rest of the building stable. It’s like putting the structure on life support while we perform the necessary surgery.

Propping isn't just a good idea; it's a non-negotiable safety measure mandated by worksafe regulations. Skipping this puts workers, residents, and the entire building at serious risk.

Removing Damaged and Delaminated Concrete
With the structure safely supported, our next move is to carefully remove all the damaged concrete. We call this the "breakout" process. It involves using jackhammers and other specialised tools to meticulously chip away every last bit of spalled, cracked, and unsound material until we get back to solid, healthy concrete.

A critical part of this stage is getting behind the reinforcing steel. We need to create enough clearance—usually at least 25mm—all around the rebar. This gives us the room to clean it properly and ensures the new repair mortar can fully wrap around it, creating a solid bond. It’s a noisy and dusty job, but it’s absolutely essential for a durable repair.

Treating the Corroded Steel Reinforcement
Once the steel rebar is fully exposed, we can finally tackle the root cause of the problem: the corrosion. The goal here is to clean the steel right back to a bright metal finish, getting rid of every speck of rust and scale. This is usually done with abrasive techniques like grit blasting or needle guns.

After cleaning, we apply a specialised protective coating directly to the rebar. This is typically a zinc-rich primer or an epoxy-based coating that does two very important jobs:

It passivates the steel: This restores the protective alkaline layer around the rebar, stopping the corrosion process dead in its tracks.
It acts as a barrier: The coating seals the steel, preventing any future moisture and chlorides from getting to it and starting the whole destructive cycle over again.
In some cases, the corrosion is so advanced that the rebar has lost a significant chunk of its cross-sectional area (often more than 20%). At that point, it’s no longer structurally sound. We then cut out the damaged section and lap and tie in a new piece of reinforcement, restoring the element's original strength. For more complex scenarios, our deep knowledge of advanced structural strengthening practices ensures we choose the right solution every time.

Applying High-Performance Repair Mortars
With the steel treated and ready, it's time to rebuild. We don’t just fill the void with any old concrete. We use specially formulated repair mortars—high-performance products engineered to bond tenaciously to the existing concrete and provide exceptional long-term durability.

The type of mortar we use depends entirely on the specific application. For instance:

Polymer-Modified Mortars: These are fantastic for general repairs, offering high bond strength with very little shrinkage.
Flowable Grouts: Perfect for overhead work or getting into tight spaces, as they can be poured or pumped into formwork to fill every void.
Epoxy Mortars: We use these for high-strength structural applications where superior chemical resistance and mechanical properties are needed.
The mortar is applied meticulously, making sure it completely encases the rebar and that there are no hidden air pockets. The surface is then finished to match the profile of the surrounding concrete, leaving a repair that is both structurally sound and visually seamless.
