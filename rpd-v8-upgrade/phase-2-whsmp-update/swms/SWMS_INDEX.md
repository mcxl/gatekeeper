# RPD SWMS Register — V8 Upgrade

## Purpose
This register tracks all Safe Work Method Statements required for RPD's Project Remediate and general remedial construction scope. Each SWMS will be generated/upgraded using Gatekeeper's SWMS Generator agent, benchmarked against Hansen Yuncken standards and Ed.6 requirements.

## SWMS Status Key
- **DRAFT** — Generated, awaiting review
- **REVIEW** — Under RPD supervisor review
- **APPROVED** — Signed off by RPD, ready for site use
- **NOT STARTED** — Yet to be generated
